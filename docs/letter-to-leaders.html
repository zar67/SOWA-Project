Hi all! Firstly I want to say thank you for taking an interest in my Scouts of the World project, the SOWA award is the last of the top awards for me to earn and so your help in achieving this award is greatly appreciated.

Clean Up is an app primarily about recording litter around your local area. As a way to get young people involved in keeping their area clean and also to provide data for where areas of high litter are. The secondary objective is to teach young people about what can be recycled and what can't, this is done through the app through various tips that popup and also the tags system which gets young people learning about different materials.

<h2 class="post-title">Downloading & Data</h2>

I want to reassure you that no personal or identifiable data is collected about any users of the app. The only information collected is the locations of the litter users record. Therefore the app is safe for young people to install on their personal phones (and can be uninstalled at any time). It should be noted that this app is location based and so does need location permissions, but the only location information kept is the locations of any recorded litter.

The app can be downloaded on Apple and Android phones from the main page of this website.

<h2 class="post-title">Briefing Young People</h2>

There is a tutorial when the app is first opened which should give young people all the information needed to use it. The app is fairly simple to use for any age.

The tags system in the app is based on the recyclable symbols found on packaging. I would suggest going through these before your start your litter pick to make sure the young people understand them. There is a PDF linked below that shows all the included tags. Tags do not have to be added to litter recordings but are there to encourage users to figure out what materials they are finding, and the recycling tips that show after a piece of litter has been recorded change based on the tags added so it is useful to add them.


<h2 class="post-title">Goals & Deadline</h2>

Part of my SMART goal when I started this project was to gain 100 users of the app, so the more people that can get involved and use it the better for me. I would also like to hear any feedback or issues at the email address linked at the bottom of this page. This app is still essentially a prototype, so issues could potentially pop up, feel free to email me these so I can continue to improve the app, your feedback is welcome!

I have arranged my presentation at a SOWA Discovery on the 3rd November, so if it's possible for you to arrange your litter pick and use the app before then that would be useful to me but not nessecary. 


<h2 class="post-title">Thank You</h2>

Again I want to say thank you for your interest in my project and getting involved to make the world a cleaner place.

Sincerely,
