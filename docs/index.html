Clean Up is an app to bring awareness to litter in local areas and educate on recycling.
In the app you can see any litter that has been found in your local area, allowing you to see hotspots of litter.
You can also record the locations of any bins in the area, these will not be updated automatically so may time some time (a few days or more) to appear.

Google has requirements for certain users and testers before the app can be published publically on the Google Play Store. Currently I have not met this threshold and so in order to download the app on Android, please complete the following steps.
The requirements for publishing a public app are to have a certain number of testers use the app for 14 days and give feedback - if you are able to help please keep the app installed for 14 days and give feedback to improve the app.

This app has been developed to work towards my Scouts Of The World Award. This is an award for people involved in Scout Network (aged 18-25) and is the only award that gives Scout Network members the chance to undertake a project of their choice within the themes of Peace, Environment and Sustainability and take action on their chosen issue.

You can find out more about the award on the Scouts website: <a href="https://www.scouts.org.uk/network/awards/scouts-of-the-world-award/">https://www.scouts.org.uk/network/awards/scouts-of-the-world-award/</a>
